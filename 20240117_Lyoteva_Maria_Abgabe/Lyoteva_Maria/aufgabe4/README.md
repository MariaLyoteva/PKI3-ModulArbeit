# Concurrent Prime Checker Extension

## Introduction
This repository contains an extended version of the Concurrent Prime Checker implemented in Java.
Now to determine which numbers are prime the Concurrent Prime Checker is using 3 different algorithms and also comparing their time performance. 
One is using simple math operations, the other to are using the Ferma's Little Theorem and the Miller-Rabin Theorem.
